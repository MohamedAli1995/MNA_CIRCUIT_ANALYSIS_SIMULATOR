1.Test module
=============
This is a single binary that performs the test. 
Physically a test module consists of one or more test source files, 
which can be built into an executable or a dynamic library.

2.Test body
===========
This is the part of a test module that actually performs the test. 
Logically test body is a collection of test assertions wrapped in test cases, 
which are organized in a test tree. 

3.Test tree
===========
This is a hierarchical structure of test suites (non-leaf nodes) and test cases (leaf nodes).

4.Test unit
===========
This is a collective name when referred to either a test suite or test cases

5.Test assertion
================
This is a single binary condition (binary in a sense that is has two outcomes: pass and fail) 
checked by a test module.

6.Test case
===========
This is an independently monitored function within a test module that consists of one or more test assertions. 

7.Test suite
============
This is a container for one or more test cases. 
The test suite gives you an ability to group test cases into a single referable entity. 

8.Test setup
============
This is the part of a test module that is responsible for the test preparation.

9.Test cleanup
==============
This is the part of test module that is responsible for cleanup operations. 

10.Test fixture
===============
Matching setup and cleanup operations are frequently united into a single entity called test fixture.
